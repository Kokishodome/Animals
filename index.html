        <h2 id="FlyingSquirrel">flying squirrel</h2>
        <p>Flying squirrels are found in various habitats across North America, Europe, and Asia. They often inhabit forests, where they can find suitable trees for nesting and gliding.
            <br> <br>
            Their diet consists mainly of nuts, seeds, berries, insects, and sometimes small birds' eggs or nestlings. They are opportunistic feeders and will eat whatever is available in their environment.
            <br> <br>
            Breeding typically occurs once or twice a year, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Female flying squirrels give birth to litters of typically 2-7 young, known as kits or pups. The gestation period is usually around 40 days.

        <h2 id="Narwhal">Narwhal</h2>

        <p>Narwhals are carnivores, primarily feeding on fish species such as Arctic cod, halibut, and squid. They use echolocation to locate prey in the dark Arctic waters.
            <br> <br>
            Narwhals are found predominantly in the Arctic waters of Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. They inhabit icy fjords, bays, and channels, often staying close to the edge of sea ice.
            <br> <br> 
            Narwhals are social animals and often travel in groups called pods. These pods can range in size from a few individuals to several hundred. Their social structure is complex, with individuals displaying various forms of communication, including clicks, whistles, and body language.

        <h2 id="PinkMantis">Pink Mantis</h2>

        <p>Head Movements: One of the most recognizable behaviors of mantises is their distinctive head movements. They can rotate their heads nearly 180 degrees, allowing them to scan their surroundings for potential prey or threats without moving their bodies.
            <br> <br>
            Life Cycle: Like other mantises, pink mantises undergo incomplete metamorphosis, consisting of egg, nymph, and adult stages. The nymphs resemble miniature versions of the adult mantis but lack wings and reproductive organs.
            <br> <br>
            Camouflage: Mantises are known for their excellent camouflage abilities. Pink mantises may blend in among pink flowers or blossoms, allowing them to remain hidden while waiting for prey.

        <h2 id="Shoebill">Shoebill</h2>

        <p>Ancient Origins: Shoebills belong to the family Balaenicipitidae, which is a small family consisting of only one genus, Balaeniceps. They are considered living fossils, with their closest relatives being extinct birds known from fossils dating back millions of years.
            <br> <br>

            Shoebills are generally silent birds but may produce deep, low-pitched grunting or croaking sounds, particularly during courtship displays or interactions with other individuals.
            <br> <br>

            These birds are large, standing about 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 meters) tall, with a wingspan of approximately 7 to 8 feet (2.1 to 2.4 meters). They are one of the largest species of stork in the world.

        <h2 id="hummingbird">Humming Birds</h2>

       <p> Smallest Birds: Hummingbirds are the smallest birds in the world. The bee hummingbird, found in Cuba, is the tiniest bird species, measuring only about 2.0 to 2.4 inches (5.1 to 6.1 cm) in length and weighing less than 2 grams.
        <br> <br>

Rapid Wing Beats: Hummingbirds have incredibly fast wing beats, with some species capable of beating their wings up to 80 times per second. This rapid motion allows them to hover in mid-air and even fly backward or upside down.
